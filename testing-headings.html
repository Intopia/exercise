<h1>Testing headings</h1>
<p>Which of the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements" target="_blank">headings</a> below are programmatically identifiable as heading elements?</p>


<h2>Gandalf</h2>
<p>A wise, wandering guide whose true power lies not in force but in inspiring courage, restraint, and moral clarity in others. He is Middle-earth’s quiet centre of resistance, always nudging events toward hope.</p>

<h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
<p>A reluctant adventurer who discovers that comfort and curiosity can coexist. Beneath his homely manners is a surprising well of nerve, humour, and decency that reshapes the fate of the world without him ever seeking glory.</p>

<p class="h3">Frodo Baggins</p>
<p> Sensitive, introspective, and burdened by a task far larger than himself, Frodo represents moral endurance. His strength is spiritual rather than physical: compassion, resilience, and the willingness to suffer so others may live free.</p>

<h4>Samwise Gamgee</h4>
<p>Loyalty made flesh. Sam is bravery without ego, love without demand, and perseverance without complaint. His grounded goodness is the emotional engine that carries Frodo—and the quest—when all other hope fails.</p>

<h5>Saruman</h5>
<p>Once wise and noble, he becomes the embodiment of corrupted intellect: a mind convinced that control is the only path to peace. His fall is a cautionary tale about brilliance severed from humility.</p>

<h6>Gollum</h6>
<p>A tragic figure consumed by obsession and self-loathing, yet still carrying shards of the person he once was. He is the shadow side of desire—a mirror of Frodo—revealing how easily love of the Ring rots identity from the inside.</p>
